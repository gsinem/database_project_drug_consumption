## Drug Consumption ER Diagram Project

### Introduction

# This project focuses on the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram 
# for a database system related to drug consumption. The ER diagram helps in 
# visualizing the structure of the database, including entities, attributes, 
# and the relationships between them.

### Project Structure

# The project includes the following main components:

# 1. ER Diagram: A visual representation of the database schema.
# 2. SQL Code: The SQL scripts used to create and manage the database.


### Dataset

# The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
# Drug Consumption (quantified) - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified. 
# This dataset contains information about individuals' drug use behaviors.

#### Attributes

# The dataset includes the following attributes:

# 1. ID
# 2. Age
# 3. Gender
# 4. Education
# 5. Country
# 6. Ethnicity
# 7. Neuroticism
# 8. Extraversion
# 9. Openness to experience
# 10. Agreeableness
# 11. Conscientiousness
# 12. Impulsiveness
# 13. Sensation seeking
# 14. Drug consumption (for various drugs such as alcohol, amphetamines, 
#     amyl nitrite, benzodiazepines, caffeine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, 
#     crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, 
#     nicotine, volatile substance abuse)

### SQL Scripts

# The SQL scripts provided in this project are used to define the database 
# schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints. The scripts are 
# organized in the following manner:

# - create_tables.sql: SQL script to create database tables.
# - insert_data.sql: SQL script to insert sample data into the tables.
# - constraints.sql: SQL script to define constraints on the tables.
